## Non-blocking communication

1. Go back to the exercise [Message chain](../message-chain/) and implement
   it using non-blocking communication.

2. Revisit one or more of the exercises in [Collective
   operations](../collectives/), replacing the communication operation(s) with
   their non-blocking counterparts.
