## Hello World with MPI

1. Write a simple parallel program that prints out something (e.g. "Hello
   world!") from multiple processes. Include the MPI headers (C) or use the
   MPI module (Fortran) and call appropriate initialisation and finalisation
   routines.

2. Modify the program so that each process prints out also its rank and so
   that the process with rank 0 prints out the total number of MPI processes
   as well.
